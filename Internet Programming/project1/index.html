	<p>
	Welcome to my page! My name is Michael and this is one of my first real webpages so I hope you enjoy!
	<br>I am a senior here at UNF with only 7 classes left, including this semester. 
	<br>The picture above is of my wife and I on our honeymoon in <a class="expand" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal" target="_blank">Portugal</a> during the summer.
	<br>We got married this year in January, on our 5 year anniversary.

	<h2 class="hobbies">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
	<p>
	
	Personally, I have quite the obsessive personality so over the years I have picked up quite a few hobbies and interests.
	<br>Playing video games is something I have loved ever since I was a child, and it is still one of my favorite hobbies to this day. On just my <a class="expand" href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)" target="_blank">Steam Account</a> I have months, if not years, worth of playtime of all my favorite games.
	<br>I also love collecting things, so over the years I have amassed a large of collection of games that I have played. I have kept and maintained almost all the games and systems I have ever used as I want to be able to share them with my children one day and it can be something that we bond over.
	<br>I even still have my original gameboy and xbox 360, my xbox being the xbox arcade which was the first model to release and it still works just fine.
	<br>Other than gaming, I love to garden. Over the last couple of years I have found the joy of gardening thanks to a bet I made with my wife, now I have an entire garden on my patio.
	<br>Finally, I am fascinated by anything <a class="expand" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction" target="_blank">Sci-Fi</a>. Halo and Star Wars are one of my favorite series and I have read many of the comics and books on top of playing and watching the games, shows and movies.
